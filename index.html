	  	<p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
	  		<p>A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of chicken breast provides 165 calories, 31 grams of protein and 3.6 grams of fat (1). That means that approximately 80% of the calories in chicken breast come from protein, and 20% come from fat.Raw chicken can harbor bacteria, such as Campylobacter and Salmonella, that can cause illness. Cooking chicken to at least 165 degrees F will kill the bacteria, but safe handling of the raw meat during preparation is important. Never wash or rinse raw chicken, and always thoroughly clean hands, utensils, and surfaces after handling raw chicken.Both uncooked and cooked chicken should be kept in the refrigerator, where it will keep for a few days. Refrigerate or freeze leftover chicken within two hours of serving.</p>

	  	<p class="item-name">Beef</p>
	  		<p>Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet. Beef is rich in protein and helps in easy weight gain.Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.</p>

	    <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
	  		<p>Sushi is often regarded as a weight-loss-friendly meal. Yet, many types of sushi are made with high-fat sauces and fried tempura batter, which significantly increases their calorie content. A single piece of sushi generally contains very small amounts of fish or vegetables.According to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish.[75] This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus.[75] Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more.[75] It is very good food for children and adults.Must eat regularly without fail.</p>
